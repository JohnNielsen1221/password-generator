## General info
This program was created to allow users to create a random password based on different criteria. They are allowed to choose Uppercase letters, Lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters, along with how many characters they would like their password to be.

## Functionality
Clicking the "Generate Password" button will instigate window confirmations asking which variables they would like their password to contain, after which a random password will be generated based on their answers.

Should scale appropriately with different screen sizes.

## Status
Project is: _complete_ (for now)
